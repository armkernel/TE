I sing to release stress. Last night, I went to a singing room with my friends. One of my friends started to sing and he wouldn't stop. I am never going to sing with him again.

My grandma suffers from insomnia really badly. She usually takes some sleeping pills to go to bed. I feel reaaly bad because she is so old. I just want her to be healthy and happy.
