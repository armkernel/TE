My grandma suffers from insomnia really badly. She usually takes some sleeping pills to go to bed. I feel really bad because she is so old. I just want her to be healthy and happy.

I sing to release stress. Last night, I went to a singing room with my friends. One of my friends started to sing and he wouldn't stop. It was not enjoyable. I am never going to sing with him again.

It was supposed to be sunny today. However it rained in the middle of the day and I got wet. It is frustrating when the weather forecast is wrong. I'll just have to carry around an umbrella in my bag all the time.

I always take a walk at the park on the weekends. It refreshes my mind and body. I love having a cup of coffee at the park after dinner. It is my favorite time of the day.

I am allergic to pollen. I have a runny nose and itchy eyes in the spring. It bothers me so much. Yesterday, I was doing a presentation in class and my nose was running like water. I was so embressed. I can't stand spring.

I like looking around convenience stores. They mainly sell snacks, beverages, toiletries, stationeries and instant food. I hardly buy toiletries and stationeries there because they are more expensive than ordinary stores.

I like playing video games when i was little. I am an only child so i used to play alone. When I was in elementary school, I made some frineds. They came to my house to play games together.

My brother is always in his room playing computer games. He eats and sleeps in his room. So I barely see him in the house. He is totally addicted to computer games.

I went on a new roller coaster in the amusement park. It was so scary. It was the most hair rising roller coaster i've ever gone on. I felt sick and exhausted after the ride.
