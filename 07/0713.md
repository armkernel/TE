It is safe to live in my neighborhood. There are many surveillance cameras in the area. So I feel safe to get around late at night. However, my mom always yells at me when I come home late. I want to live alone.

I liked playing video games when I was little. I am an only child so I used to play alone. When I was in elementary school, I made some friends. They came to my house to play games together.

My brother is always in his room playing computer games. He eats and sleeps in his room. So I barely see him in the house. He is totally addicted to computer games.

- I went on a new roller coaster in the amusement park. I was so scary. I was the most hair rising roller coaster I have ever gone on. I felt sick and exhausted after the ride.

- I was on a diet for five days. I have been limiting my self. But then I burgin ate yesterday. I ate a slice of cake, three scoops of icecream and five pieces of chocalates after dinner.
