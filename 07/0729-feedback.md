I always retouch my pictures with photoshop before I post them on Facebook. My pictures look much better with photoshop. I think Photoshop is the greatest thing ever.

I like going to the bookstore. It is fun looking around the booksotre. When I have time, I just go there and pick up some books even though there is nothing in particular I want to buy.

I don't like going shopping with my girl friend. When we go shopping, it takes forever. She usually spends 5 hours on shopping. She tries on everything. It makes me feel stressed.

I like to watch youtube viedo clips through my phone. I used too much data for the internet on my phone. It is hard to set a time that works for both of us. I think she is too busy.

I don't like eatting alone. When I have no one to eat with, I just skip it and have some bread instead. When I was taking classes by myself, I lost 5 kg in one semester.
